===============
1. Overview
===============

The b5-ref corpus is a collection of descriptions of human photos from the Face Place database (Righi,  Peissig  & Tarr, 2012) and Big-5 personality inventories, produced by participants in a controlled experiment for a number of studies on personality-dependent referring expression generation.

The descriptions were originally written in Brazilian Portuguese and subsequently annotated with their semantic properties as attribute-value pairs, all of which represented in XML format.

Details (in Portuguese) of the b5-ref contents  are described here:

2. Data
=======

The b5-ref corpus consists of 1822 descriptions produced by 152 participants in 12 visual contexts each. The following data sets are provided:

The [description] folder contains the actual description sets (hereby caled trials) produced by each of the 152 speaker and their annotation as attribute sets. The attribute sets are represented both as a series of XML nodes. Details of the annotation scheme are described in the above publication. 

The file [b5-ref-contexts.xml] is the XML representation of the 12 stimulus scenes used in the experiment. Each scene is identified by an ID tag discussed below.

The [images] folder contains the 12 scenes seen by the speakers in the experiment built from Face Place images. The target in each scene is identified by a red border. Image filenames correspond to the context ID referred to in each corpus descriptions, in order of presentation.

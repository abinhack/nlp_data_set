lexical-features-with-subject-info.csv 
and 
id-lexical-features.csv 

are essentially the same file, except that the former shows additional info (taken from the corpus subjects table) in the last few columns.

Both files use Portuguese CSV file separator characters (i.e., semicolon ";" as field separator and comma "," for decimals) as opposed to English separators (comma "," as field separator and dot "." for decimals). 

In order to open these files on an English version of Microsoft Excel, WEKA and others, please proceed as follows:

1. Open the file using a standard text editor
2. Replace all "," for "."
3. Replace all ";" for ","
4. Save the modified file
